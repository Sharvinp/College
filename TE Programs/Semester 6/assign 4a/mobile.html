            <p>It was the best of times, it was the best of times. I'm just saying, any summer that includes more than one American muscle car is a good summer.

I've been hooning around … ahem, "enjoying" … Motor Trend's long-term 2015 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 whenever its caretaker, Scott Evans, is called away on business. Hoo boy, that Z/28 is something special. However, it requires your full, complete, careful attention at every turn. Fun but not quite my cup o' tea. Just before a long weekend, however, keys to a 2015 Camaro SS 1LE landed in my lap. Hmm, a little like the Z/28 but without that razor's edge. Had the Z/28 desensitized me with its lovely powerband and ridiculously stiff but eager chassis? I thought maybe all those lower-spine impacts had taken their toll.</p>

            <p>The interior is nice, too. Get in a fifth-generation Camaro (even the SS 1LE), and you're reminded constantly that you're sacrificing for performance. In the Mustang, not so. A swath of material that looks like engine-turned aluminum cuts a handsome horizontal line across the cabin, the armrests are padded leather and adorned with yellow contrast stitching, the instruments and gauges are high-quality and look nice, and fun details such as "ground speed" on the speedometer complete the feel. The interior makes you feel like you're in something special.</p>
